Wikitionary for Personal

The application to extract content from wiktionary.org according to the needs of a personal mini dictionary (anyway, my personal preferrence at last.) and organize them in the form of XML. User could provide a list of words so that the program extract relevant items. The format is very simple, just one line per word.

Install java and download the distribution zip which contain the application jar and all other jars of tools used. Open a command window, run "java -jar wiktionary.jar". Click "run" button to download the html from wiktionary and extract contents into database and an XML file will be generated in the directory of "dict" specified in the property file. Before that , you have to prepare a text file and put it in the directory of "db".

Once finished, you can use Apache FOP to generate PDF according to your own needs.

If you don't want to do all lengthy steps by your self. you can download the PDF file here.
